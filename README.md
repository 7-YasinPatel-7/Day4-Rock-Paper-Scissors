# Rock-Paper-Scissors🪨🧻✂️
I bet you cant win against this evil computer game🤖. This game require a lot of thinking and implementing power.🤔 Give it a try and see if you are superior than a computer😈
•Day 4 of learning python. I got demotivated a bit on this day. Not because python is not good but because I made a lot of mistake in small simple things...🫠
•On this day I learnt about:
•••List[]
•••Nested List[ [], [], [] ]
•••Randomisation. The random module and other usuful random modules.
•••The understanding of offset and appending items to list.
•••Various index errors🤯 and how to debug them, where and how to look for solutions.
•••And many more.. 
•This project thaught me how LOGICALLY challenging things can get but always try to break down big problems into small structures. 
•Also an ASCII Art is kind of a brilliant way to make something Enjoyable.😁
